# My Learning Progress

## Week 1 — LLM Foundations
- [x] Basic single API call
- [x] Conversational loop with memory
- [x] Refactored chat into function
- [ ] Journal agent mini project

## My Notes
- messages list is stateless — you manage memory yourself
- system prompt sets rules once, never append again
- always check quit before appending to messages
- assistant reply must be appended for memory to work

## My Work
All my exercises and mini projects are in the `my-work/` folder
